1ngdmhj,Anxiety,1757810897.0,Shortness of breath is ruining my enjoyment,"I started having shortness of breath about 4 years ago, and it's been going on and off.

I've had tests before and the doctors saw nothing abnormal, they did ECG, X-RAY, checked my Vitals and did a blood sample test, it freakin wierded me out cause I was almost sure that there was something wrong with me physically.

I even got ambulanced because I had a panic attack cause I felt like couldn't get enough air and I was feeling light headed, but guess what everything was exactly as my tests before... perfectly fine, I honestly was wishing that something was gonna come up so I could finally get an answer and closure on this.

Fast forward to today, I'm having it again and it's kinda bad, I can't fully focus on things I do, and I can't fully enjoy alot of things because I lose focus on it because I unintentionally focus on satisfying my breathing, I also keep yawning which is another annoying quirk of this thing. I have tried some breathing excercises and it kinda works, having deep focus seems to be the most effective though, whenever I'm like fully focused and immersed on a task breathing becomes automatic and normal.. til all of a sudden I remember about my breathing... because for some reason whenever I'm focused and immersed it kinda feels foreign and awesome now to the point where my brain eventually notices that hey this feels really good you're deep into focus because you forgot about your breathing, which in return reminds me about it ruining the whole thing slowly.

There were times where I'm fully fine for about a month or 2 but then it just comes back, I am unbelievably annoyed that this is still not resolved and I'm just dealing with it feeling like there it no hope for me to go back to normal, it kinda feels like this is already attached to me mentally since it's been years so anytime I get reminded or I remember it, it just comes back to me almost without fail, it kinda feels like the only time I can go back to normal is if I get some sort of amnesia to forget this whole issue if you get what I mean.

Anyways this is mostly venting as I don't know anyone who understands this feeling, if you have any suggestions though and advices I would honestly love to hear it and try it out.

1lvrhvq,HealthAnxiety,1752088398.0,Psychologist's advice for me and you.,"So, I've been going through a medical whirlwind, and I cry about it to my psych often. Here's what she said. Rules of thumb, if you will.

Googling is bad, especially in specific side effects and symptoms! Because it compiles EVERY possible aspect, especially meds side effects! (because companies have to list them.) Google also isn't likely to take the rareness of these symptoms and side effects into consideration either. You likely read things that a FRACTION of people experience but of course Google compiles all of it. She said to me... weigh the chances, possibilities and operate with occam's razor in mind. Essentially, it is lacking nuance.

About Reddit. When you research things, anecdotal evidence is usually not as impartial right? When people come to Reddit, they are coming with specific symptoms usually in SPECIFIC subreddits... essentially it is going to become a cycle of confirmation bias, once you start looking up your specific symptoms on reddit. This is what happened to me with the CUTI community, which I had to mute for my own sanity... She said, that mild things most likely won't have dedicated subreddits or posts with high engagement rates.

Most importantly, people who heal, get better and don't experience complications, are NOT LIKELY TO POST ON REDDIT! Of course you feel terrified of the illness you might or might not have because you are only reading negative stories and experiences. Look up success stories. If you really need advice, seek out doctors. If that is expensive, like it was for me so many times, people working at pharmacies are also available for questions and can give supplements/suggestions for medications. I did this when I in fact was diagnosed but was still experiencing weirdness mid treatment. :-)))) 

So, 1: Google isn't nuanced. 2: Reddit is biased. 3: DON'T keep yourself guessing, you are not a professional and you WILL spiral.

My psychiatrist advised to keep reminding myself of my own anxiety. I am constantly on high alert, and I am certain you guys are too. Before distractions, remind yourself of your hyper-vigilance. 

Stay calm, give any symptoms time. The body is INCREDIBLY complicated. Mom always says: It's really hard to die. True! She was attacked by a panther at her old job at a Zoo at age 21. Still alive and kicking! If the symptoms subside, the body is bodying. 3-4 days in, doctor. You will be okay.

1nhstng,mentalhealth,1757958576.0,quit or continue therapy?," I’m having a bit of a conundrum and would love any advice or different perspectives. I have been on and off therapy for about six years and in that time I’ve seen several different therapists. I don’t have a therapist through my insurance so I typically look for sliding scale therapy.

During a particularly anxious summer, I decided to look for another therapist and was eventually matched with someone who focused on anxiety and also was trained in EMDR. The EMDR intrigued me as I’m someone who intellectualizes my problems and has done talk therapy for years. I don’t have any major big T traumas, but I certainly have memories that could use processing. I’ve been seeing this therapist for a little over a month and we’ve had maybe four or five sessions. The problem is I do not vibe with her energy whatsoever. It’s hard to explain what the issue is but she’s very soft spoken and quiet to the point that I feel awkward during sessions. I know the first few sessions are “getting to know you” but even when I’m discussing my past, she’s not really giving me any meaningful follow up questions. I’m also realizing that I think I prefer to have a therapist that is older than me (I’m 31).

I’m hesitant to end my sessions with her because I JUST went through the process of finding someone new. Also, I’m intrigued by EMDR and happy I found someone in my budget who is EMDR trained. Overall, though, I do not think it is the right fit. I’ve been dreading our sessions. I am also concerned that EMDR might not even be helpful for me, especially if I don’t feel comfortable with the therapist. We are supposed to start EMDR soon.

Should I cancel my future sessions? The thought of doing so makes me cringe. If so, what should I say? Should I try EMDR with the therapist?

Since my teenage years started ive seen myself as an npc, a type of character in video games that has no role and is just existing without a purpose.

Which lead me into being isolated for my whole teenage years and ending up lonely without memories or friends or hobbies. It’s not a serious thing that could lead me to commit self harm. Im studying a good branch in uni ive been blessed with wonderful parents who provided a stable life for me im so grateful for that. But it’s just that im a nobody in this world, i see other people’s interests boring and i sometimes force myself into some of them but i quickly realize this isn’t for me.

1nghaeo,TrueOffMyChest,1757822297.0,I relapsed and hurt someone I care for.,"*Additional Trigger for alcoholism*

I (30F) was sober for a little over a year (May 26th, 2024 to August 1st, 2025). At the time, I had a FWB that I had been steady with for about 3 months (Approximately end of April through beginning of August). We knew eachother prior from middle school and run around the same friend circles.

To make a long story short, in those 3 or so months, he healed and comforted parts of me that other people had broken, torn up, and abused. He is one of the most sweetest, genuine, understanding guys I have ever met in my life. In just that short amount of time, we got to where we shared everything with eachother, no holds barred.

He had done everything in his power to not tempt me to relapse, even saying he would abstain from alcohol around me. I encouraged him to do as he always did because ""My sobriety is my responsibility.""

How did I repay that? I relapsed over one weekend over at his place and drank his alcohol when he wasn't looking. He figured it out after I had left that weekend, and, deservedly, stopped talking to me. I started becoming suicidal from shame and guilt, not just from hurting him, but everyone I lied to. I started self harming and writing goodbyes in my phone notes. A couple days later, after nealy attempting to go through with it, I went to detox/rehab to get back on track. (August 6, 2025)

From inside, I was able to get ahold of him since I took down his number before my phone was taken. He visited me while I was in rehab and assured me that he was still there for me, as much as he could be, but we would need to just be friends for awhile. I agreed since my recovery had to take priority.

I am one month sober now, going to an IOP program and working the steps like my life depends on it (because it does), but he has grown more and more absent, stating he's ""busy"" which I know is true. But it feels like when the benefits went away, some of the friendship we had to start died too. Maybe I'm overreacting, but that's just how I am feeling.

I don't know why its breaking my heart so bad. Do I have feelings for him? I guess maybe I developed some somewhere down the line, but I don't even have any ground to stand on with them. I screwed up. I get that.

Anyway, what triggered this offmychest was the song ""Back To Friends"" by sombr. I am feeling the full weight of my actions and its so painful that the person I confided everything and anything to a month ago, I can't even ask how he's doing some days. I just feel like I'm bothering him. I don't think any amends I make will ever be enough to restore the friendship, at the least, and I am starting to feel hopeless. I just want my friend back.

For more than three years now, I have watched my wife slowly devolve into a shell of herself. I am no psychiatrist or psychologist, but I have done a little bit of research and tried to diagnose which I know can be problematic. The reason I’m doing this however is because she’s not doing it for herself.

At high level, she’s extremely paranoid. What she actually is paranoid about is confusing because she’s not being honest when I ask her. Partially the reason she’s not being honest is because I believe she thinks I’m involved with some sort of gang stalking behavior. This is not conjecture because she’s literally hired a private investigator to scan our house for bugs.

That’s not all. More often than not I hear her talking to basically nobody. If she was talking to herself it would be one thing, but she seems to be talking to a disembodied group of people. From what I can gather, she seems to believe that these people are watching her every move and can even read her thoughts.  when she speaks aloud to these people she constantly brings up the idea of a lawsuit, some sort of high visibility lawsuit of persecution against women and minority women specifically. she seems to believe that at some point, her gang stalkers will be brought to justice and she’ll be vindicated.

More recently, I’ve noticed a complete disassociation with the world around her . She completely ignores entire sentences and conversations with me. she’s obviously deep in thought and distracted by something.

What this means for me is that I have become a caretaker. She’s actually highly functioning in that she has a job, however, my entire life now revolves around ensuring she’s comfortable and hopefully avoiding a psychotic break. I’m stepping on eggshells yet still cracking eggs because there’s no way to know what she will perceive as confirmation of my involvement in the gang stalking.

This manifests in anger as well. Im angry that she won’t talk about it, and doesn’t believe anything is wrong.

I’ve tried to inform her family, but they can do nothing. There are no avenues for reporting or giving her help that she doesn’t think she needs. As a husband, I feel obligated to fulfill my duty that I expressed in my vows during our wedding day. I said I would be her partner in sickness and health.

This is her being sick.  however it feels different because I’m not willing to help someone that isn’t willing to help themselves. Not only that, I’m getting pressure from family and friends to move on.

**Update:**   
First of all, I am so thankfull for all of your helpful comments and advice. I have had a lot of people reach out in the DMs with advice and just chatting about how this feels. It's nice to know that I am far from alone and that there's hope with good communication.  
  
I was ready to just drop this side of myself but as some of you pointed out, it is far from fair to let this be a secret. I would be so devasted if I knew he felt the way I do and kept it from me without opening up to me about it. So i will be talking with him soon and spill my heart out to him. I love and trust him and no matter what happens, I know we'll come out stronger and my chest will be lightened.  
  
Weird thing is, last night we slept together and it was amazing. He was rough and caring with me and I had such a good time. I asked him this morning if he had fun as well and he kissed me and said yes. So I am very hopefull and will be suggesting buying some toys and maybe playing the ""rank my kink"" game to see if he's curious about some kinks or new things.   
  
Thank you all for taking your time with commenting on my post. To those of you who find me disgusting, please look inward and confront your own demons so you can meet the world more open minded.

Let me start of by saying that I absolutely love my(f30) fiancé(m36). He is understanding, calm, responsible and one of the silliest people I know. I love him and he is the only one that matches my goofiness and can make me laugh 'til my stomach hurts and comfort me when I'm having a bad day.

Still, I have some kinks, that he won't/can't explore with me. I like mdom and would like to try being tied up, being degraded or maybe even some masked roleplaying... Ofc with some aftercare and intimacy. He knows that I'm a sub, but is too shy to take on the dominant role to that degree.

Occasionally he will squeeze my throat when I'm on top and one time he did it in missionary, which drove me absolutely crazy and gave my one and only orgasm from only penetration. I told him how much I loved it, but he hasn't done it since.

We only have sex once a month or so and it always starts in the middle of the night, so there's not much time to explore. Of course it feels good and I love being intimate with him, it's just not exciting. I think he believes that my decreasing libido has to do with my weight gain and insecurity. Honestly it is easier to let that be the ""truth"", than tell him that I'm bored with our sexlife, because I know he won't be comfortable trying out the rougher stuff and much less enjoy himself.

The only way I get to enjoy my kinks is by listening to audioporn. Afterwards, I sometimes cry because I am so sad that I will never get to experince any of the like in real life with the man I trust and love. I only have the voices of strangers online and it feels so goddamn lonely, lying in our bed and trying to listen for his footsteps so he doesn't walk in on me. I also feel bad for him, because I hide my true sexdrive..

I am so extremely fortunate to have found my soulmate and I can't wait to marry him and spend the rest of our lifes together.

Quite frankly, in my review, I believe the business model is simple, and the long-term growth prospects are fair, and because of my purposely conservative valuation model, I also feel that there is significant mispricing.

I am officially covering the stock with a **Buy** rating and a **price target of $18.00**, which implies a 50% upside from the current share price around $12.00.

# Company Background

To fully comprehend Aebi Schmidt Group's investment case, we must first grasp the unique history and strategic rationale that shaped the company into the global industrial powerhouse it is today.

The story begins in two separate towns in Europe. In 1883, Johann Aebi commenced a workshop in Burgdorf, Switzerland, that became synonymous with greatness in mastering alpine agriculture. Aebi's brilliance was in engineering machinery that could safely and easily operate on steep, challenging slopes of land that were otherwise impossible to traverse. This inherent practicality developed an orientation of specialized, high-traction vehicles for challenging surfaces that became the foundation of the Aebi brand. For over a century, the Aebi brand has existed as the market-proven solution for municipalities and farmers with challenges of steep or mountainous terrain—a natural choice based on engineering capabilities in a highly specialized market.

The reason I like to re-run them every few weeks is that as information gathers and data resolution increases, I like to get fresh analyses from ChatGPT and Gemini from various different angles to see how the new data influences the final outcome. It's sort of a very convoluted journaling practice, which is why I can't supply screenshots.

Anyway, I uploaded the files and ran the prompts, and usually I can chat for a while after all nine prompts have done their thing, but today, I only got three additional prompts before I was cut off and booted to a new chat.

Yes, I was exclusively using GPT 5 Thinking, but that's never been a problem in the past.

I then hit a similar wall with another chat I didn't even put the prompts into. And I think I might have hit another in a different chat too.

I’ve struggled with this cycle of productivity and then being in a rut for years now. 

It’s like I pick myself up, and out of a rut and then I do great at pursuing my goals and I’m happy and motivated.

Then, something happens in my personal life or I miss a day of my routine and everything falls apart and I’m back in my rut until one day I pick myself up again and the cycle repeats.

I’m sick and tired of this. I want to be done with this cycle so badly. I just struggle with perfectionism and all or nothing thinking which makes my day to day life very difficult for me mentally.

Beyond this, I feel like the current rut I’m in is lasting much longer than the past ones have. I graduated college last June and I’m still struggling to find a full time job. I did work at an internship for six months that just ended so it’s not like I did nothing but I haven’t secured a full time job in my desired industry yet. 

I know I need to get a job but struggling with the job hunt for this long PLUS being stuck in this rut is messing with my mind.

I feel so lost. I feel like logically my brain knows what I need to do to find a job but I can’t seem to actually do the tasks to find the full time job. Like I just feel frozen and unable to do it.

My average screen time was literally7+ hours. I used to wake up and already have a phone in my hand? And used to scroll while laying on bed (and one hour already gone) no doubt why I was annoyed most of the times ofc of the over usage of the phone.

What I did wasn’t revolutionary, but it worked:

- I put all my distracting apps in one folder and named it do You Really Need This?
-putting phone in the grayscale mode, yes that works no one wan look at the screen without no color.
-giving my phone to my mom or brother while I was working or doing some imp work, just to keep the accountability.

- Left my phone in another room for a couple hours a day, put in a room completely out of your reach or somewhere at a distance. You wouldn't automatically wan stand up and get that (and if you get that urge, take it as a warning sign my friend)

These platforms have a variety of costs that are far from negligible. They must employ a range of professionals, including programmers, accountants, and IT personnel, to ensure the smooth operation of their services. Additionally, they bear the expenses of hosting their websjtes and distributing their applications through cloud services like AWS or Azure.

Moreover, the delivery personnel deserve fair compensation for their time and the use of their vehicles. 

I understand that it can be frustrating to see a burrito, which might seem reasonably priced at $14, end up costing $30 or more after fees. However, it's important to recognize that the delivery cost was never going to be zero. The initial allure of low fees was largely a result of venture capital investments, which created an illusion of affordability. That mirage has dissipated, and it's now necessary to confront the reality of these operational costs.

I empathize with those who rely on these services due to circumstances such as disabilities or health conditions.

Additionally, they bear the expenses of hosting their websjtes and distributing their applications through cloud services like AWS or Azure.

Moreover, the delivery personnel deserve fair compensation for their time and the use of their vehicles. 

I understand that it can be frustrating to see a burrito, which might seem reasonably priced at $14, end up costing $30 or more after fees. However, it's important to recognize that the delivery cost was never going to be zero. The initial allure of low fees was largely a result of venture capital investments, which created an illusion of affordability. That mirage has dissipated, and it's now necessary to confront the reality of these operational costs.

I empathize with those who rely on these services due to circumstances such as disabilities or health conditions. It is unfortunate that they are burdened by what can be in essence a ""disability tax."" Nevertheless, this does not alter the underlying truth that these apps and services require revenue generates by the added fees operate.",0
1ms98yl,unpopularopinion,1755381802.0,Eminem Needs to Retire From Rapping,"Eminem’s impact on rap is undeniable and yes he’s a true legend. BUT there comes a time when, as much as we love his bars, nobody really wants to hear their grandfather rap. Rap thrives on youth and raw energy, and while Em still has the skills, I think sticking around too long risks diminishing his legacy. There’s something powerful about retiring gracefully.

Ironically, this reminds me of a line from ""Without Me,"" where Em takes a jab at Moby, calling him “too old” at 36 and telling him to ""let go"". It's a little funny to think that Em is now in that same position himself, getting up there in age. It’s just a part of life, and like he said, sometimes it’s time to “let go.”

Eminem doesn't need to prove anything anymore. He’s done more than most in the rap game ever could. It’s time for him to retire from rapping and go focus on being a grandpa.

You absolutely do need to stretch if you want to touch your toes or move your hips in any manner other than that of a robot. It will help you in many aspects of life and prevent injuries. Yes, the timing matters and you don't need to be holding static stretches before you do something physical, but it needs to be done at some point, preferably right before bed.

1n4y0sc,unpopularopinion,1756654996.0,Modding videogames is disrespectful to the developers and it misses the point of engaging with a videogame,"I think modding games is childish and stupid. And I'm not just talking about mods that ""yassify"" female characters or change the sexuality of characters to make them romanceable (which are both particularly bad!) I mean ANY mod that's not made specifically by the development team. 

When you play a game, you're playing the result of thousands of combined man hours of design decisions, concept art, narrative discussions, worldbuilding etc. If you want to mod in a new car... No, the design team already decided who the big car makers are, what markets they serve, who their clients are... They already did a bunch of careful worldbuilding that went through hours of checks and re-checks to make sure it's consistent tonally with the rest of the game! Want to mod in a new gun? A new type of player home? A new  storyline? No. No. No. If they game makers decided they wanted that to be in the game, they would put it there. 

ANY mod is disrespectful to the intention of the artists involved. What right do you have to mess with an artist's art? To me it's like fan fiction (which I also hate and think is stupid and childish)... If you were reading a book and then ripped out pages and wrote in new sections, or started crossing out lines and writing in new ones, people would think you were a psycho. Why is doing it with games any different?

Modding games is amateurs mucking with art that they don't understand. Every mod. Every time. And sometimes you see videos online like ""These are the five essential mods for this game"" shut the fuck up. There's no such thing. How dare you.

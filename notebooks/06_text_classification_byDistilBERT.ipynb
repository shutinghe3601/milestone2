       "       [\"Equity X-Ray: In-Depth Research #23 I feel the market is misunderstanding the transitional shift in the Aebi Schmidt Group (AEBI). After its reverse merger with The Shyft Group, the market is stuck on the ghost of the old company and has yet to shift its view to a new global industrial leader, with a competitive business model, not to mention a remarkable valuation inconsistency. I feel investors are diluting their view on the company's strong, and non-discretionary revenue drivers, and historically powerful free-cash-flow-generative business model, because they view the merger as so complicated. Quite frankly, in my review, I believe the business model is simple, and the long-term growth prospects are fair, and because of my purposely conservative valuation model, I also feel that there is significant mispricing.\\n\\nI am officially covering the stock with a\\xa0**Buy**\\xa0rating and a\\xa0**price target of $18.00**, which implies a 50% upside from the current share price around $12.00.\\n\\n# Company Background\\n\\nTo fully comprehend Aebi Schmidt Group's investment case, we must first grasp the unique history and strategic rationale that shaped the company into the global industrial powerhouse it is today.\\n\\nThe story begins in two separate towns in Europe. In 1883, Johann Aebi commenced a workshop in Burgdorf, Switzerland, that became synonymous with greatness in mastering alpine agriculture. Aebi's brilliance was in engineering machinery that could safely and easily operate on steep, challenging slopes of land that were otherwise impossible to traverse. This inherent practicality developed an orientation of specialized, high-traction vehicles for challenging surfaces that became the foundation of the Aebi brand. For over a century, the Aebi brand has existed as the market-proven solution for municipalities and farmers with challenges of steep or mountainous terrain—a natural choice based on engineering capabilities in a highly specialized market.\\n\\nFull article [HERE](https://www.gb.capital/p/equity-x-ray-in-depth-research-23-aebi)\"],\n",

       "       [\"Psychologist's advice for me and you. So, I've been going through a medical whirlwind, and I cry about it to my psych often. Here's what she said. Rules of thumb, if you will.\\n\\nGoogling is bad, especially in specific side effects and symptoms! Because it compiles EVERY possible aspect, especially meds side effects! (because companies have to list them.) Google also isn't likely to take the rareness of these symptoms and side effects into consideration either. You likely read things that a FRACTION of people experience but of course Google compiles all of it. She said to me... weigh the chances, possibilities and operate with occam's razor in mind. Essentially, it is lacking nuance.\\n\\nAbout Reddit. When you research things, anecdotal evidence is usually not as impartial right? When people come to Reddit, they are coming with specific symptoms usually in SPECIFIC subreddits... essentially it is going to become a cycle of confirmation bias, once you start looking up your specific symptoms on reddit. This is what happened to me with the CUTI community, which I had to mute for my own sanity... She said, that mild things most likely won't have dedicated subreddits or posts with high engagement rates.\\n\\nMost importantly, people who heal, get better and don't experience complications, are NOT LIKELY TO POST ON REDDIT! Of course you feel terrified of the illness you might or might not have because you are only reading negative stories and experiences. Look up success stories. If you really need advice, seek out doctors. If that is expensive, like it was for me so many times, people working at pharmacies are also available for questions and can give supplements/suggestions for medications. I did this when I in fact was diagnosed but was still experiencing weirdness mid treatment. :-)))) \\n\\nSo, 1: Google isn't nuanced. 2: Reddit is biased. 3: DON'T keep yourself guessing, you are not a professional and you WILL spiral.\\n\\nMy psychiatrist advised to keep reminding myself of my own anxiety. I am constantly on high alert, and I am certain you guys are too. Before distractions, remind yourself of your hyper-vigilance. \\n\\nStay calm, give any symptoms time. The body is INCREDIBLY complicated. Mom always says: It's really hard to die. True! She was attacked by a panther at her old job at a Zoo at age 21. Still alive and kicking! If the symptoms subside, the body is bodying. 3-4 days in, doctor. You will be okay. \\n\\nMuch love.\"],\n",

I have been on and off therapy for about six years and in that time I’ve seen several different therapists. I don’t have a therapist through my insurance so I typically look for sliding scale therapy.\\n\\nDuring a particularly anxious summer, I decided to look for another therapist and was eventually matched with someone who focused on anxiety and also was trained in EMDR. The EMDR intrigued me as I’m someone who intellectualizes my problems and has done talk therapy for years. I don’t have any major big T traumas, but I certainly have memories that could use processing. I’ve been seeing this therapist for a little over a month and we’ve had maybe four or five sessions. The problem is I do not vibe with her energy whatsoever. It’s hard to explain what the issue is but she’s very soft spoken and quiet to the point that I feel awkward during sessions. I know the first few sessions are “getting to know you” but even when I’m discussing my past, she’s not really giving me any meaningful follow up questions. I’m also realizing that I think I prefer to have a therapist that is older than me (I’m 31).\\n\\nI’m hesitant to end my sessions with her because I JUST went through the process of finding someone new. Also, I’m intrigued by EMDR and happy I found someone in my budget who is EMDR trained. Overall, though, I do not think it is the right fit. I’ve been dreading our sessions. I am also concerned that EMDR might not even be helpful for me, especially if I don’t feel comfortable with the therapist. We are supposed to start EMDR soon.\\n\\nShould I cancel my future sessions? The thought of doing so makes me cringe. If so, what should I say? Should I try EMDR with the therapist? Any advice is appreciated.\\xa0']],\n",

In just that short amount of time, we got to where we shared everything with eachother, no holds barred.\\n\\nHe had done everything in his power to not tempt me to relapse, even saying he would abstain from alcohol around me. I encouraged him to do as he always did because \"My sobriety is my responsibility.\"\\n\\nHow did I repay that?

(August 6, 2025)\\n\\nFrom inside, I was able to get ahold of him since I took down his number before my phone was taken. He visited me while I was in rehab and assured me that he was still there for me, as much as he could be, but we would need to just be friends for awhile. I agreed since my recovery had to take priority.\\n\\nI am one month sober now, going to an IOP program and working the steps like my life depends on it (because it does), but he has grown more and more absent, stating he\\'s \"busy\" which I know is true.
